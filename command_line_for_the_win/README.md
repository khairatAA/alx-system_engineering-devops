# Project: Command line for the win

##Specific

Here are the steps to follow:

- Take the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
- Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
- Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
- Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
- Use the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
- Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
- Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.
- Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project’s README.md file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.
- NOTE :
- The screenshoots of completed level should be inside the dir /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
